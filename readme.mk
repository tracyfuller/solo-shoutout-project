###README

This repository has too many files. 
Main files in the project are:

+ index.html
+ app.js
+ stylesheet.css

There are additional files that are not currently being used, but have been formated and are ready for future use:

This project is an exercise in taking a large set of data and displaying it one piece at a time using animations.
